# Breast Cancer Classification with Machine Learning

![Breast Cancer](breast_cancer_image.png)

## Introduction

This project aims to create a machine learning model to classify breast tumors as malignant or benign based on features extracted from digitized fine needle aspiration (FNA) images of breast masses. We use supervised machine learning classifiers to achieve this classification task.

## Dataset

We have used the Scikit-Learn `load_breast_cancer` dataset, which consists of features computed from digitized breast mass images. These features describe characteristics of cell nuclei present in the images. The target variable indicates whether a tumor is malignant (0) or benign (1).

- Total Patients: 569
- Features: 31
- Data Size: 137.9 KB

## Data Description

The dataset contains 569 patient records, each with 31 numeric features. These features include various statistical measures and characteristics of cell nuclei. Here's a summary of the numerical distribution of the data:

- Mean:
  - Feature 1: [mean_value_1]
  - Feature 2: [mean_value_2]
  - ...
- Standard Deviation:
  - Feature 1: [std_deviation_1]
  - Feature 2: [std_deviation_2]
  - ...
- Minimum:
  - Feature 1: [min_value_1]
  - Feature 2: [min_value_2]
  - ...
- Maximum:
  - Feature 1: [max_value_1]
  - Feature 2: [max_value_2]
  - ...
- 25th Percentile:
  - Feature 1: [25_percentile_1]
  - Feature 2: [25_percentile_2]
  - ...
- Median (50th Percentile):
  - Feature 1: [median_1]
  - Feature 2: [median_2]
  - ...
- 75th Percentile:
  - Feature 1: [75_percentile_1]
  - Feature 2: [75_percentile_2]
  - ...

## Machine Learning Pipeline

We will follow these steps to build and evaluate our breast cancer classification model:

1. Data Preprocessing: Prepare the data by handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

2. Model Selection: Experiment with various supervised machine learning classifiers, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, etc., to determine the best-performing model.

3. Model Training: Train the selected model on the training data.

4. Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

5. Model Deployment (Optional): If desired, deploy the model for real-world predictions.

## Results

We will report the model's performance metrics and provide visualizations of important factors in the classification process. Results will be included in the project's documentation.

## Usage

Instructions for running and reproducing the project's results will be provided in the project code and documentation.
