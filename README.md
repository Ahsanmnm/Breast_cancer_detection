## Introduction

This repository contains a deep learning model for the detection of breast cancer in medical images. Breast cancer is a significant health concern, and early detection can greatly improve patient outcomes. This project uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify mammogram images as benign or malignant.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is the [Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images) available on Kaggle. It contains thousands of histopathological images of breast tissue.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the notebooks)
- [Kaggle API](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api) (for downloading the dataset)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-detection.git
